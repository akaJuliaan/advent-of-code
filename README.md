# Advent of Code 🎁❄️☃️🤶🎄 
My solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. I started this year, so only the 2025 directory exists.
All solutions are currently written in **Python**, maybe I will add some **C#** or **C** solutions too.

> [!NOTE]  
> I usually complete most tasks on the side, so I don't pay attention to whether they are efficient or high-performing. On the contrary, most are simply functional.
